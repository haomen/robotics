A new recurrent neural network, called the dual network, is presented in this paper. The proposed neural network is composed of a single layer of neurons, and the number of neurons is equal to the dimensionality of the workspace. The proposed dual network is proven to be globally exponentially stable. The proposed dual network is also shown to be capable of asymptotic tracking for the motion control of kinematically redundant manipulators}},
