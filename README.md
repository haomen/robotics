1. Neural network apply to wireless sensor network, focus on 

1. Feed forward neural netork.
2. Recurrent Neural network, time-series for singal processing
2.1 Need Training 
2.2 no need training

3. utilizing singal from wsn.

4. paralell processing of wsn, this algorithm fits for parallel. distributed algorithm and scalable.

5. theorial contribution, iterative algorithm convergence.
